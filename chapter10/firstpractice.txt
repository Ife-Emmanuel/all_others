The world needs electrical engineers, imagine a life without electricity, I know you would not want to give your brain such a torment, because it is actually unimaginable.  That is why I would never relent on my quest to be a world class electrical engineer. Power is the major challenge of my country (Nigeria) and that coupled with other reasons has precipitated me to want to study electrical electronics engineering, so as to be a problem solver like many other great men and women of the world who had brought about comfort to humanity through their well of knowledge.
 Electrical electronics engineering is an all-encompassing engineering field that has the following specializations: Radio-Frequency Engineering. Signal Processing, Microelectronics, Control Systems, Power Engineering and Telecommunications. I am particularly interested in power engineering. power engineering involves the generation and transmission of electricity and my decision to study at the University of South Australia was borne of the desire to get the very best of education in a serene, quiet and beautiful environment with practical know how in Australia and University of South Australia boast of been a University with all its assessed engineering research rated well above world-class and it's ranked 25th in the world 50 under 50 universities and it came up tops in my mini university league too compared to other universities my reasons for choosing UNISA owes to the faster application turnaround time, standard of education, affordable fees, internships, unique access to work placements, seminars, tours and modules like renewable and distributed energy generation, advanced machine modeling, operation and control of modern system and power generation from renewable energy sources that well suites my future aspirations. Passion, they say does not really make any difference until and unless one makes a move, hence my reason for this application
I had my first degree (B.Eng. Electrical/Electronic Engineering) from the prestigious Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Ogun State, between the years 2012â€“ 2018. I look forward to acquiring knowledge that is sufficient enough to bring electricity to all parts of the world at a cheaper rate and in a less cumbersome systemThe number of words in the file C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\python_crash_course\chapter10\firstpractice.txt350The number of words in the file C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\python_crash_course\chapter10\firstpractice.txt357The number of words in the file C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\python_crash_course\chapter10\firstpractice.txt364The number of words in the file C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\python_crash_course\chapter10\firstpractice.txt371The number of words in the file C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\python_crash_course\chapter10\firstpractice.txtNoneThe number of words in the file C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\python_crash_course\chapter10\firstpractice.txt385The number of words in the file C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\python_crash_course\chapter10\firstpractice.txt392The number of words in the file C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\python_crash_course\chapter10\firstpractice.txt399The number of words in the file C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\python_crash_course\chapter10\firstpractice.txt406The number of words in the file C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\python_crash_course\chapter10\firstpractice.txt413The number of words in the file C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\python_crash_course\chapter10\firstpractice.txt420
